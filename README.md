## Getting Started
The following instructions will guide you on how to make the project work on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing
Bitnana uses [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) as framework to get a customizable HTML/CSS/JS workspace with automatic package management. 

### Running the app
After installing meteor, open a console and enter
```
cd C:\<path>\<to>\<project>\dev
meteor
```

Meteor will begin by installing the dependencies of the project and then you will be able to test Bitnana via [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
